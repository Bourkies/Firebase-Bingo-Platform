# This is an example workflow file.
#
# 1. Copy this file to `firebase-hosting-pr.yml`.
# 2. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Firebase Project ID.
# 3. The `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_YOUR_PROJECT_ID` secret is created automatically
#    when you run `firebase init hosting:github`.
#
# This workflow deploys a preview channel to Firebase Hosting when a pull request is opened.
